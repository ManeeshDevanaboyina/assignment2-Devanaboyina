###### Paris
Paris is unlike any other location on Earth, **its beauty is unparalleled, the number of famous structures is incredible**, and its allure attracts a large number of people each year. It seemed impossible that such simple structures could have so much charm. **The Eiffel Tower is the most significant reason why I like Paris**.
